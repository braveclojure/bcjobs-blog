title: A Better Clojure Job Board
date: 2021-09-20
---

I've rebuilt [Brave Clojure Jobs](https://jobs.braveclojure.com/) to **make it
effortless to advertise Clojure jobs.** If you're hiring, I want you to be able
to get a job listing in front of interested devs in less time than it takes you
to sing Queen's _We Are the Champions_. Watch how easy it is to sign up and post
a listing:

Here's what's new:

* **Itâ€™s now freemium.** You can post as many listings as you want without
  giving a credit card number. Charging per listing is nice for the job board's
  owner (me!), but I don't think it's the best model if the job board is to be
  as _useful_ as possible. The most useful job board would include every
  available opening, so I've tried to remove barriers to that goal. At the same
  time, I do want to make money with this endeavor; I'll describe the paid
  benefits below.
* **You can import listings.** If you manage listings with Greenhouse, Workable,
  and similar services you can just paste a listing's URL to import it.
* **You can duplicate listings.** You can now create new listings from existing
  listings. The theme here is: make it super easy to create listings!
* **Copy/paste preserves formatting.** If you copy a listing you've created
  elsewhere and paste it in Brave Clojure Jobs, it will preserve the formatting,
  automatically converting it to markdown. I hope you'll find that this kind of
  attention to detail makes using Brave Clojure Jobs a great experience :D
* **Companies are first-class.** You can now create a company profile. Your
  profile page will include links to all your listings, and it will appear in
  the site's company directory.
* **I've filled out your company profile for you.** I have been creating
  profiles for dozens of companies looking for Clojure developers. Be on the
  lookout for a link from me which will allow you to easily create a Brave
  Clojure Jobs user account associated with your company. The video shows how
  this works. I really want to make it easy for you to connect with a large
  audience of Clojure developers.

If you go through the process of "sign up with pre-filled company profile then
import listing" you could have a listing published in a minute or less.

**Removing barriers to posting listings results in more listings.** This makes Brave
Clojure Jobs more valuable to developers, growing the site's audience, which in
turn makes it more valuable to companies. It's a virtuous cycle. (Side note: I'm
really patting myself on the back for using the term "virtuous cycle.")

I also want to definitively show that **companies are hiring Clojure
developers**, now more than ever. In this way, I hope the site benefits the
Clojure community as a whole by correcting the perception that not many places
hire Clojure devs. I still see people ask, "Can I get paid to write Clojure?"
It's a concern for anyone considering learning the language; it's a large time
investment and people naturally want it to pay off. I want to show that **the
payoff is real**.

Indeed, I've seen a considerable uptick in Clojure job postings in 2021. More
and more companies want to hire people to write Clojure because they know doing
so brings tangible benefits. This site will be the beautifully-designed proof.

So, a secondary goal of this rewrite is to create a marketing tool for the
community: I want something we can point to to show that **if you learn Clojure
won't just become a better programmer, you'll also gain access to expanded
career opportunities**. This will help grow the community, which in turn will
help us <span style="text-decoration: line-through">take over the programming
world</span> make the language an even more viable choice for everybody.

There are many more changes -- the UI is leagues better, there's better
integration with Stripe so you can manage payments without having to contact me,
etc. etc. etc. The main point is that I want the site help us all as much as a
job board possibly can. My hope is that this massive upgrade, which I've worked
on for over a year, will be good for companies, good for developers, and good
for the entire Clojure community.

## Sponsorship benefits

There are three sponsorship levels available to companies: $75/month,
$150/month, and $250/month. Paying for a sponsorship gives you greater exposure:
paying companies are listed on the home page as "sponsors", and their listings
are highlighted and placed higher. Sponsor companies will also have their jobs
tweeted and sent to the Brave Clojure Jobs mailing list.

Over time I want to continue increasing supporters' reach by placing listings in
more channels. For example, on the [public product
roadmap](https://trello.com/b/KLvxGv7u/product-roadmap), one of the first items
is "post bi-weekly job roundup to reddit.", and it's just one idea for how I
want to provide value for subscribers.

Another idea is to include badges or some kind of flair for subscribing
companies to help your company stand out. For example, I want to create a
"conference sponsor" badge. Conference sponsors deserve public recognition, and
I think highlighting such contributions is valuable for job seekers, as it's
more appealing to work for companies that we know are giving back to the
community.

If you have ideas for what you'd like included in a paid subscription, please
let me know! You can reach me by email,
[daniel@braveclojure.com](mailto:daniel@braveclojure.com). You can also upvote
items on the [product roadmap](https://trello.com/b/KLvxGv7u/product-roadmap) if
they strike your fancy.

The takeaway here is that there are currently some subscription benefits focused
on increasing your listings' reach, and there are some in the works.

## Supporting Brave Clojure Jobs

At the same time, I have to be honest that I'm uncertain about the ROI for
sponsoring. I believe that the benefits will provide real value, but right now I
don't have the data to create a precisely compelling sales pitch for just how
much better you'll do if your company becomes a sponsor.

Ultimately, I wanted to rebuild the site because I value generosity. Engaging
with others from a spirit of generosity just feels better to me. I wanted to
invest the effort to make improvements and switch to a freemium model because I
believe it will help everybody.

Still, wwitching to freemium feels a little risky: I may end up making less than
before. You never know, right? But I want to try to contribute more to a
community that has been so good to me. I think I've accomplished that. I also
want to keep improving the site, and paid sponsorships help me do that.

**My goal is to reach $2,000 a month in sponsorships**. That level of support
would would be huge for me, and it would make it viable for me to continue
investing my time in the site, something I'm excited to do. If you believe that
this is a worthwhile endeavor and that it will help everybody in the long run,
including you and your company, then I hope your company will become a sponsor.

## Thank you early sponsors!

In the seven weeks since I quietly re-launched the site on August 1st, five
companies have already become sponsors! This is incredible to me, and I am very
grateful to them:

* [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/)
* [Pitch](https://pitch.com/)
* [Gower St](https://gower.st/)
* [Vara](https://www.vara.ai/)
* [Shortcut](https://shortcut.com/)

## Job Seekers

My aspiration for this site is that it will make it easier for you to find a
Clojure job / gig / contract / bounty by gathering every opportunity in one
place. The job board currently boasts more than double the number of listings
the previous version ever displayed, and I only expect this to increase.

What other changes would be useful to you? Please feel free to email me at
[daniel@braveclojure.com](mailto:daniel@braveclojure.com) to share your ideas!

## A Personal Note

I believe that work should be as enjoyable as possible. Part of what makes work
enjoyable is using expertly crafted tools, and that's why I continue to
appreciate Clojure. Nearly a decade in I still love it, and I feel extremely
lucky that I get paid to build stuff with it. I hope this site makes it possible
for more people to do the same.
